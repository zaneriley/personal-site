Project Summary: Internationalization (i18n) and SEO Optimization for a Phoenix LiveView Application

This project focuses on enhancing the i18n capabilities and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) features of your Phoenix LiveView application. The main objectives are:

    Robust i18n Support:
        Determine the user's preferred language based on their browser's Accept-Language header, the URL path (e.g., /en/, /ja/), or a stored session preference.
        Correctly redirect users based on their preferred locale, including handling unsupported locales and default locale fallbacks.
        Enable dynamic switching between supported languages (English and Japanese) within the LiveView interface.
        Generate appropriate hreflang tags for SEO purposes, indicating the different language versions of each page.

    Dynamic Content for SEO:
        Support dynamic page titles, descriptions, and Open Graph (OG) tags to improve search engine visibility and social media sharing.
        Render dynamic JSON-LD schema markup (e.g., person_schema) to provide structured data to search engines.

Key Requirements and Considerations

    Locale Redirection:
        Allow requests to proceed when the URL includes a supported locale (e.g., /en/, /ja/).
        Respond with a 404 status for unsupported locales in the URL.
        Redirect to the user's preferred locale when no locale is specified in the URL, utilizing the user_locale session variable.
        Redirect to the default locale when no locale is specified and there's no user preference.
        Handle edge cases, such as:
            Empty path segments (e.g., //en/)
            Unsupported locales as non-first segments (e.g., /case-study/helping-people-find-healthcare)
            Case-insensitive locale handling (e.g., /EN/)

    Locale Setting:
        Set the locale based on the Accept-Language header, URL path segment, or session value.
        Prioritize the session locale if it's set.
        Fall back to the default locale if no locale is specified.
        Set the Content-Language response header to match the selected locale.
        Handle unsupported locales by setting the default locale.
        Ensure that locale settings are not applied to static asset requests (e.g., /images/logo.png).
