# Zane Riley's Product Design Portfolio

This repository houses my product design portfolio, showcasing various projects and designs I've worked on. The portfolio is built using Phoenix (PETAL stack basically). The foundation of this portfolio is based on the excellent example provided by Nick Janetakis' [docker-phoenix-example](https://github.com/nickjj/docker-phoenix-example), which offers a solid starting point for Phoenix applications with Docker.

## Portfolio Overview

Extremely product-focused designer with 10+ years of experience based in Tokyo, Japan. 

Focused on building things that help people beyond the screen. My ultimate goal is to make things that help people shape the future they desire, not a future that is imposed upon them. 


## Features

Still a WIP, but I hope to self-host this on my homelab here in Tokyo. Possibly on solar power and porting in self-reported weather data. Dunno if I can do it, and it's massive scope for a portfolio, but let's try it anyway.

## Tech Stack

I chose this tech stack almost entirely because I wanted to build something with Elixir. 

### Back-end

- [Elixir and Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/): For server-side logic and web page rendering.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): As the database for storing project data and user interactions.

### Front-end

- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/): For an extremely fast JavaScript bundler and minifier.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): For utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/): For beautifully crafted SVG icons.

### Additional Technologies

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): For containerization and ensuring consistent development and production environments.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions): For CI/CD pipelines and automated deployment processes.

## Acknowledgements

A special thanks to [Nick Janetakis](https://nickjanetakis.com) for creating the docker-phoenix-example, which served as the foundation for this portfolio.
